PortaNote is yet another note-taking app made with the help of Firebase as a backend service. This repository implements the frontend for the web app using NextJS/React.

Key Features:

-   Create unlimited notes with a title and content
-   Edit existing notes if required to change the title or content
-   Notes are sorted according to the modified time of the note
-   Delete notes if not required
-   Uses a beautiful monochromatic theme for ease of use
-   Powerful and secure authorization. Thanks to Firebase.

## Built With

-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
-   [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
-   [next/font (Google Fonts)](https://fonts.google.com/)
-   [react-icons/Material Design](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/icons/md/s)

## Getting Started

Go to [https://portanote-web.vercel.app/](https://portanote-web.vercel.app/) to get started.

Or, to locally run the app, clone the repository. Add the `firebase.js` config file generated by Firebase to the root of `src/app/` folder. Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
